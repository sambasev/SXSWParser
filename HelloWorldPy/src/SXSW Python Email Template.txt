Hi Name1/Name2,
I'm an independent artist and composer who grew up on Bollywood music. My inspirations vary from A.R.Rahman, Missy Elliot, Zedd, to Jacob Collier, Trent Reznor, and John Williams. I came across your video in SXSW and would love to bring a new flavor to your future works. 

Here's my demo reel: https://soundcloud.com/sambasevam-shanmugam/madrazi-sambasevam-music-demo-reel-1

A few reviews of my music: "Stunning. Breath-taking. I wasn't promised a beer to say this. Nope."
